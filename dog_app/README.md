# Image Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

### Project Description

In this project I used a deep learning architecture from the Keras library to develop a model that could differentiate between pictures of humans and dogs. Specifically, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network, termed a Sequential model in Keras. As part of the project I also developed a model that could identify dog breeds from photos. 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

The main code for this project is located in the `dog_app.ipynb` notebook file.  Additionally, the `Report.html` file contains a snapshot of the main code in the jupyter notebook with all code cells executed

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `dog_app/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
